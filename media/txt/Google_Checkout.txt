experiment with new payment system, as many members know, we have had a lot of problems with pay pal, the company that processes our credit card orders, this has been very frustrating for us, and very frustrating for many of our members, we apologize for the problems some of you have had with pay pal, we do have some good news yesterday, we switch to a different system we are now trying to go check out, in general goodwill is the much better company with much better customer service we have talked to them about our needs and concerns, and we are hopeful that global checkout system will be a big improvement, we plan to test double check out for two weeks then decide whether to switch permanently,
